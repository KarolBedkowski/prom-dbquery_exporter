# dbquery_exporter v0.7.x

The dbquery_exporter allow to scrap metrics from supported SQL databases by user-defined SQL-s
and templates.

Support: SQLite, PostgrSQL/Cockroach, Oracle, MySQL/MariaDB/TiDB and MSSQL (not tested).

## Templates

Templates use standard golang text/template format (see: `https://pkg.go.dev/text/template`).

Template should generate real, correct text-formatted Prometheus metrics. Result is
not validate by dbquery_exporter.


### Template context

Data available in tempaltes:

* `.R` - list of records generated by executing query; each record is map
  column name -> value;
* `.Query` - query name (from request/config)
* `.Database` - database name (from request/config)
* `.P` - additional request parameters
* `.L` - labels defined for database
* `.Count` - total number of query result
* `.QueryDuration` - query duration in sec
* `.QueryStartTime` - start query as UNIX time (time of real execution; caching not
  change it)


### Template functions

* toLower - convert value to lower case
* toUpper - convert value to upper case
* trim - trim non-printable characters
* quote - quote " characters
* replaceSpaces - replace spaces by "_"
* removeSpaces - remove spaces
* keepAlfaNum - keep only A-Za-z0-9 characters
* keepAlfaNumUnderline - keep only A-Za-z0-9 and "_" characters
* keepAlfaNumUnderlineSpace - keep only A-Za-z0-9, "_" and space characters
* keepAlfaNumUnderlineU - keep only unicode letter, digits and "_"
* keepAlfaNumUnderlineSpaceU - keep only unicode letter, digits, space and "_"
* clean - keep only A-Za-z0-9 and "_", replace spaces to "_", trim, convert to lower case


# Requests

## Database scrape

One on more `database` argument is required.
At least on query (defined by `query` or `group` arguments) is required.

Simple query:
`http://localhost:9122/query?query=<query_name>&database=<database_name>`.

By group:
`http://localhost:9122/query?group=<group_name>&database=<database_name>`.

Multiple queries:
`http://localhost:9122/query?query=<query_name>&query=<query_name2>&database=<database_name>`.


## Other endpoints

* `/health` - simple health status
* `/info` - current loaded configuration (available only from localhost)


# Note

Oracle return column in upper case. Probably NLS_LANG environment variable should be also used in most cases (i.e. `NLS_LANG=American_America.UTF8`).

All queries should be reasonable fast - long queries should be avoided. As a rule of thumb - each request should take no more 1 minute.

There is a simple protection preventing to run exactly the same queries (request) parallel.
When next query arrive it may wait up to 5 minutes to previous request finished. After 15 minutes from start
query is considered as death and next request will be processes.

There is also simple caching mechanism - for each query there can be defined timeout in which previous result
of query will be returned. This helpful when metrics are gathered i.e. every minute but there is no need to
get data from database that often.
